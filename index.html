    <td><p>Lien grew in the Vung Tau province of Vietnam, as one of eleven children.  Her upbringing was modest, but full of family love.  Some of her earliest memories were of helping her mother sell soup to the neighbors and passersby.</p></td>
    <td><p>In elementary school and middle school, Lien excelled in academics, and was a promising badminton player.  It was her successes that allowed her to be accepted to a university of economics, in Ho Chi Minh City.  Although needing to balance schoolwork and the part-time to pay for her education, she graduated in 4 years with degrees in both economics and international trade.
</p></td>
    <td><p>After working in international trade for 10 years, Lien had opportunities to move to either Australia, where an older sister lives, or to the United States where her older brother lives.  She opted for the latter.
</p></td>
    <td><p>After moving to the United States in 2012, she eventually met her husband-to-be, Eric Sommers, and they raise three children together.  They currently live in Omaha, NE and call that home.  Is it this family life that display well her greatest characteristics:  She is kind-hearted, loving, patient, and energetic.  The members of her family are benefactors of all these wonderful traits.
</p></td>
    <p><td>Despite her degrees from the Vietnamese university, Lien has embarked on a career of esthetics, specifically with a focus in permanent makeup and eyelashes.  As she works to grow that business, she works also at a local nail salon.</td></p>
